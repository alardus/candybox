package_builder
===============

- candybox-'package.version' - package contains a set of original 'deploy' configs and scripts and are easy to upgrade (just download a new version of this package and youâ€™re done).

- repo-update.sh - builds packages 'candybox', 'xl2tpd-kernel' and creates Packages.gz for those packages. After that you may copy folder 'ubuntu' content to repository.
