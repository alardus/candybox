simple beeline xl2tpd configurator

In some bad happens I remove my previous realization of configurator.
So, here it is another one. Currently no design.

1. Start it as root with

$ python cava.py

2. Open your browser to 'hostname:8080'. If you start this configurator first time, input new password for configurator access.

3. Right after that you can change your configuration


This version not tested at all. Please double check!
